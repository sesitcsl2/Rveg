\title{RvegToJuice:
Export an Rveg Database to JUICE compatible format}
\usage{
RvegToJuice(database, export = "export", checklist = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{Character. The path and name of an existing Rveg database
to be exported (e.g., \code{"path/to/my_db"}).}

\item{export}{name of your exported csv file}

\item{checklist}{Character. The species checklist to use. By default, the function
attempts to read the checklist specified in the database's metadata. You can
override this by providing a custom file path or a built-in dictionary string.}
}
\value{
Writes two text-based CSV files to the location specified by \code{export}:
one containing the header data (\verb{*H.csv}) and one containing the relevé
species data formatted with JUICE headers (\verb{*R.csv}).
}
\description{
Exports an existing \code{Rveg} database into a format directly compatible with
JUICE, a comprehensive software for vegetation classification. This function
processes both the species composition data and the header data, formatting
them to meet JUICE's import requirements.
}
\details{
To ensure seamless compatibility with JUICE, this function performs several
background transformations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Layer Mapping:} Rveg layers are automatically converted to JUICE's numeric layer representations (e.g., Tree layer "3" becomes "2", Shrub "2" becomes "4", Herb "1" becomes "6", etc.).
\item \strong{Absence Encoding:} Zero values (\code{0}) are converted to \code{.}.
\item \strong{Encoding:} Files are written using \code{ISO-8859-15} encoding, which is the standard expected by JUICE for proper character rendering.
}

For JUICE import first import relevé data as Spreadsheet file and follow with Header data as Tab delimineted file.
